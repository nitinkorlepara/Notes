# Distributed Systems

- Also known as distributed computing and distributed databases, a distributed system is a collection of independent components located on different machines that share messages with each other in order to achieve common goals.

- Distributed systems must have a network that connects all components (machines, hardware, or software) together so they can transfer messages to communicate with each other.
